# Cloud Computing Homework 1 - Containers and Virtual Machines

## Project Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of **virtual machines (VMs)** and **containers** by running a simple web server using both **Vagrant** for VM and **Docker** for containers, and evaluating them through load testing.

We used **Vagrant** to create and manage both the virtual machine server and a client VM for load testing with `wrk`. Additionally, we used **Docker** to host the server as a container on the host machine, allowing us to compare both methods of deployment.

### Requirements Recap:
- **Server**: One computer running **Vagrant** and **Docker**.
- **Client**: One computer with **Vagrant**.

### Experiments:
1. **Experiment 1**: Host the server using a **virtual machine** created with Vagrant, running **NGINX**.
2. **Experiment 2**: Host the server in a **Docker container** on the host machine.

- **Vagrant File for Server in VM**: [Vagrantfile (Server)](https://github.com/ronygsp/Vagrant-vs-Docker/blob/main/vagrant-server/Vagrantfile)
- **Docker File for Server in Container**: [Dockerfile (Docker Server)](https://github.com/ronygsp/Vagrant-vs-Docker/blob/main/docker-host-server/Dockerfile)
- **Vagrant File for Client with `wrk` Tool**: [Vagrantfile (Client)](https://github.com/ronygsp/Vagrant-vs-Docker/blob/main/vagrant-client/Vagrantfile)

## Commands to Replicate the Load Test

### Experiment 1: Virtual Machine with Vagrant (Server)

1. **To Start the Server with Vagrant**:
   ```sh
   vagrant up --provider=virtualbox
   ```
   This command sets up the virtual machine and installs **NGINX**.

2. **To Start the Client and Conduct the Load Test**:
   ```sh
   vagrant ssh  # Connect to the client VM
   ./wrk -t2 -c100 -d180s http://192.168.33.10:80
   ```
   This command runs a **load test** for **180 seconds** with **100 concurrent connections**.

### Experiment 2: Docker Container on Host

1. **To Build the Docker Image and Run the Container**:
   ```sh
   docker build -t nginx-host-server .
   docker run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx-host-container nginx-host-server
   ```
   This builds the Docker image and runs the container to host the web server.

3. **Alternatively if its already built**
   ```sh
   docker start nginx-host-container
   ```

3. **To Conduct the Load Test from the Client**:
   ```sh
   ./wrk -t2 -c100 -d180s http://172.17.112.1:80
   ```

### Results Summary:

- **Experiment 1 (Vagrant/VM)**:
  - **Requests per Second**:
    - Test 1: **3501.23 requests/sec**
    - Test 2: **3100.22 requests/sec**
    - Test 3: **3066.09 requests/sec**
  - **Transfer Rate**:
    - Test 1: **0.89MB/sec**
    - Test 2: **811.24KB/sec**
    - Test 3: **802.31KB/sec**

    - Test 1: **1.74MB/sec**
    - Test 2: **3.42MB/sec**
    - Test 3: **2.96MB/sec**

### CPU and Memory Utilization Comparison:

1. **Virtual Machine Server (Vagrant)**:
   - **CPU Utilization**: The CPU usage stayed consistent at relatively **low percentages** throughout the load testing. It handled a moderate amount of requests but lacked the spikes and adaptability seen in Docker. It experienced higher latency as the load increased, indicating its slower response time.
   - **Memory Utilization**: The memory usage was steady, generally using more resources than Docker due to the added overhead of running a full operating system.

2. **Docker Container (Host)**:
   - **CPU Utilization**: Docker containers exhibited **higher CPU usage**, with dynamic utilization that peaked during heavier loads. The **CPU usage reached 50-55%**, which indicates more efficient resource handling due to the reduced overhead.
   - **Memory Utilization**: Docker's memory consumption was **lower** compared to the VM, making it a better option for environments where resources are limited. The containerized approach avoids the resource-heavy nature of running a complete guest OS.

### Key Differences

1. **Performance**:
   - **Docker containers** were able to handle significantly more requests per second compared to the VM. This is because containers share the hostâ€™s OS, which eliminates the need for managing additional OS layers, reducing latency and resource consumption.
   - In the **VM**, the latency increased with higher concurrent connections, leading to a less responsive environment under heavy loads.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The VM environment showed consistent resource usage but with increased **latency** and **lower throughput**. The **higher latency** in handling requests suggests that the virtual machine's overhead affects its efficiency.
   - **Docker** was more resource-efficient, had faster startup times, and could handle a greater number of requests per second. It used **less memory** compared to the VM, showing that containers are well-suited for rapid scaling.

3. **Scalability**:
   - **Docker containers** have advantages in environments requiring rapid scaling and quick startup, whereas virtual machines take longer to provision and are heavier in terms of resource use.

### Conclusion

The experiments demonstrate that Docker containers are generally more **efficient** in terms of **resource utilization**, **response time**, and **handling concurrent requests**. They have lower latency and can process a higher number of requests per second compared to virtual machines. Virtual machines, while providing better isolation, come at the cost of increased overhead.
